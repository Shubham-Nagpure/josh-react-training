      t the point calling the function, the rest of the page has not been rendered and
      so the id test is not in existence at that point. So script will not change anything.
      document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = "Goodbye World";

      Ideally a javaScript function is placed in the <head> section of an HTML page.
      The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked.
    </script> -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- <script>
      At the point calling the function, the rest of the page has not been rendered and
      so the id test is not in existence at that point. So script will not change anything.
      document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = "Goodbye World";
      We can achive this with
      window.onload = function () {document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = "Goodbye World";}
    </script> -->

    <h1 id="test">Hello World!</h1>

    <script>
      // This script will execute and change 'Hello World!' to 'Goodbye World',
      // because at the time when this script execute html is already rendered and script will able to find id test.
      document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = "Goodbye World";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
